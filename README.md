# üí° Random Message Generator

An application that generates a random message on the click of a button. The message consists of 3 main sections, the introduction, middle and end. Each section has its own dedicated array containing the words that form a phrase when combined with one another. 

When the 'generate' button is clicked, a random index is generated for each array which corresponds to a random element in each array. These elements are then joined together to form the final quote/phrase.
